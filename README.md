# LIRI-Node-App
A Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. Powered by Node.js.

### Overview

This CLI app allows you to search for information about concerts, songs, and movies. In order to interpret the user's commands and return the requested information, LIRI makes use of the following technologies:

* a CLI, or command-line interface, such as Command Prompt or Git Bash
    - The user-end part of the app, the interface with which the user operates and communicates with LIRI. It is this app's counterpart to the browser used to access a website and, as such, is up to the user's personal preference.
* Node.js
    - The bridge between the CLI and the logic coded in JavaScript.
* JavaScript
    - The logic that determines LIRI's behavior and which links user inputs to the APIs from which the requested information is fetched.
* APIs
    - The application programming interfaces which provide the requested information. These include:
        * Bands in Town
        * Moment
        * Spotify
        * OMDb
* Axios
    - A node package used to retrieve data from the Bands in Town and OMDb APIs.
